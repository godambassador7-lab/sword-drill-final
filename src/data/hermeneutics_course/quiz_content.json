            "Being too spiritual",
            "Finding hidden meanings while ignoring the plain, literal sense",
            "Recognizing legitimate typology",
            "Emphasizing the Spirit's role"
          ],
          "correct": 1,
          "explanation": "Over-spiritualizing or excessive allegorizing finds hidden spiritual meanings while ignoring the text's plain sense. While Scripture uses figures and types, we must first honor the literal-historical meaning. Not everything is a secret code; sometimes the straightforward meaning is the intended meaning."

          ],
          "correct": 1,
          "explanation": "The covenant lawsuit follows an ANE treaty pattern: summons, charges, evidence, verdict. Prophets used this familiar form to present God's case against covenant-breaking Israel. Understanding this form helps us grasp the structure and rhetorical force of prophetic books."

          "options": [
            "Community is unnecessary; interpretation is purely individual",

          "correct": 2,
          "explanation": "While individuals must study and apply Scripture personally, community (local church, broader Christian tradition) provides accountability, catches our blind spots, corrects individualistic misapplications, and helps us understand how Scripture applies to corporate life. We interpret as part of the church, not in isolation."
