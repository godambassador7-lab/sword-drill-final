HEREMENEUTICS LEVEL 1 — FOUNDATIONS

1. What Is Hermeneutics?
Hermeneutics means the art and science of interpreting Scripture. It combines rules, history, language, culture, and literary tools so the text’s meaning becomes clear.

2. Why Interpretation Matters
Examples:
- “Day” (יוֹם) can mean 24 hours or a longer period depending on context.
- “Heart” (καρδία / לֵבָב) often means inner being, not the physical organ.

3. The Four Pillars
A. Historical context — Who wrote it? When? What was happening?
B. Literary context — Genre: narrative? poetry? prophecy? epistle?
C. Linguistic context — Key words, grammar, verb tenses, idioms.
D. Canonical context — How does this passage fit with the rest of Scripture?

4. Genre Study Basics
Examples:
- Narrative: Look for plot movement.
- Poetry: Parallelism counts!
- Prophecy: Symbolism and covenant imagery.

5. Practice Section
Interpret: “The Lord is my shepherd.” Identify metaphor, historical setting, and author’s intention.
