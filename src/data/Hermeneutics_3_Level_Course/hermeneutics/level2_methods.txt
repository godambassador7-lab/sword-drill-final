HERMENEUTICS LEVEL 2 — METHODS & TOOLS

1. The Grammatical-Historical Method
Focuses on what the original author intended, not modern assumptions.

2. Word Studies (without falling into errors)
Example: “Dunamis” ≠ “dynamite.” Avoid etymological fallacies.

3. Contextual Circles
Verse → Paragraph → Chapter → Book → Testament → Whole Bible

4. Figures of Speech
- Metaphor
- Metonymy
- Synecdoche
- Hyperbole
Practice: Identify the figure of speech in Isaiah 1:18.

5. Cultural Backgrounds
Examples:
- Shepherding metaphors in 1st century Judea  
- Covenant treaty formulas in Deuteronomy  
- Honor/shame culture in NT writings  

6. Common Fallacies
- Cherry-picking  
- Proof-texting  
- Reader-response interpretation  

QUIZ:
1. Define the grammatical-historical method.
2. Why is “dunamis = dynamite” incorrect?
