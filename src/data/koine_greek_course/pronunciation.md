# PRONUNCIATION GUIDE

## Erasmian vs Koine
- Koine tends toward smoother, less aspirated pronunciation.
- Example: ει, η, ι, υ, οι → merged toward “ee”.

## Consonants
- γ before κ γ χ ξ → nasal “ng”
- ρ at word start is aspirated (“hr”)

## Dipthongs
- αι = “eye”
- ει = “ay/ee”
- οι = “oi”
- αυ = “ow”
- ευ = “eh-oo”
