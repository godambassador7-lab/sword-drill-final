# The Feasts and Jesus in the New Testament

This document sketches how the New Testament uses the language, timing, and imagery of the
biblical feasts to communicate who Jesus is and what He has done.

## 1. Passover and Unleavened Bread

- Jesus' final week is framed by Passover.
- The Last Supper reorients Passover symbols around His death.
- Paul calls Messiah "our Passover," linking redemption from Egypt to redemption from sin.

## 2. Firstfruits and Resurrection

- The resurrection occurs in the Feast of Unleavened Bread / Firstfruits window.
- Christ is called the "firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep," signaling a harvest
  of resurrection to come.

## 3. Pentecost / Shavuot and the Spirit

- The Spirit's outpouring occurs at the pilgrimage feast of Weeks.
- The gathering of many nations anticipates the gospel going to all peoples.
- Torah written on stone is paralleled by the Spirit writing God's law on hearts.

## 4. Tabernacles, Light, and Water

- At Sukkot, Jesus proclaims Himself the source of living water and the light of the world.
- The backdrop is the water‑drawing ceremony and lamp‑lighting in the Temple courts.

## 5. Atonement and Priesthood

- Hebrews reads the Day of Atonement ceremonies as shadows pointing to Jesus' priestly work.
- He enters the true sanctuary once for all, securing eternal redemption.

## 6. Dedication and Witness

- At the Feast of Dedication, Jesus speaks openly in the Temple about His identity as the
  Good Shepherd and One with the Father.

Taken together, the feasts form a **calendar‑shaped proclamation of the gospel**. Recognizing
these connections helps us read Scripture more deeply and celebrate God's work more fully.
