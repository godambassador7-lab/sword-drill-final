# Biblical Feast Days Repository

This repository is designed as a **reference library and data source** for applications that need
a historically grounded, Bible‑centered view of the **feast days and celebrations** in the Old and
New Testaments, together with **practical guidance on how to participate in them today** without a
Temple and sacrificial system.

It is structured for use in:

- Bible study apps and assistants
- Teaching tools
- Theological research
- Discipleship and family worship resources

The focus is on:

1. **Biblical foundations** (Torah, Prophets, Writings, Gospels, Acts, Epistles).
2. **Historical context** (especially Second Temple practice where relevant).
3. **Christ‑centered / New‑Covenant perspective** (how the New Testament engages the feasts).
4. **Practical participation today** (how to remember and honor these days in a way that is
   faithful to Scripture even without Levitical sacrifices).

## Structure

- `feasts/`
  - Detailed Markdown studies for each feast and sacred time.
- `data/`
  - Machine‑readable JSON describing the feasts, suitable as a data source in apps.
- `guides/`
  - “How‑to” participation guides for believers today.
- `theology/`
  - Theological reflections and synthesis (OT + NT + early church implications).

This repo does **not** attempt to bind anyone's conscience. It aims to present the feasts
**as Scripture presents them**, explain how they were lived out in biblical times as far as
we can tell, and offer **wise, historically sensitive ways** to remember them today.
