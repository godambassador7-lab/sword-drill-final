# General Guide: Participating in the Biblical Feasts Today

This guide explains **how to approach the feasts** as a follower of Jesus in a way that honors
Scripture and historical context.

## 1. Start with Posture, Not Perfection

The goal is not to reconstruct every ancient detail but to:

- Remember God's mighty acts.
- Rehearse the story of redemption.
- Teach the next generation.
- Rejoice, repent, and give thanks.

It is better to keep the feasts **simply and sincerely** than elaborately and anxiously.

## 2. Respect the Once‑for‑All Sacrifice

Because Messiah's sacrifice is complete, we do not attempt to:

- Imitate Temple animal sacrifices.
- Treat our observance as earning righteousness.

We remember that the feasts **point to** Messiah and are fulfilled in Him.

## 3. Use the Calendar as a Discipleship Tool

The feasts can shape the year around:

- Redemption (Passover / Unleavened Bread / Firstfruits).
- Empowerment and mission (Shavuot).
- Repentance and joy (Trumpets, Atonement, Tabernacles).
- Providence and courage (Purim).
- Dedication and light (Hanukkah).
- Weekly rest and worship (Sabbath).

## 4. Keep Conscience and Charity

Believers differ on how binding these observances are. Key principles:

- Do not judge or despise others based on feast‑keeping.
- Welcome those who honor days differently.
- Let everything be done in faith and love.

## 5. Practical On‑Ramps

If you are new to the feasts:

1. **Begin with Passover and Unleavened Bread**, using a simple home meal that tells the story.
2. Add **Shavuot** as a day of reading Exodus 19–20 and Acts 2, with thanksgiving for the Spirit.
3. Explore the **fall feasts** as a season of repentance and joy.
4. Consider Purim and Hanukkah as narrative‑rich times to remember God's preservation.
