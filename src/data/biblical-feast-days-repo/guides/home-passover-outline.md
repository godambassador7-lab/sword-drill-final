# Simple Home Guide: Remembering Passover in Light of Messiah

This outline is meant as a **flexible framework**, not a rigid script.

## 1. Preparation

- Choose an evening in the Passover season.
- Prepare:
  - Unleavened bread.
  - Bitter herbs (e.g., horseradish or similar).
  - A simple main meal.
- Remove obvious leavened breads from the table as a sign.

## 2. Opening

- Light candles if desired.
- Pray, thanking God for deliverance from bondage and asking Him to be present.

## 3. Tell the Exodus Story

- Read key portions of Exodus 12 and related passages.
- Briefly explain:
  - Slavery in Egypt.
  - God's judgments.
  - The lamb and the blood on the doors.
  - The hurried departure.

Encourage questions, especially from children.

## 4. Connect to Messiah

- Read a Gospel passage where Jesus shares Passover with His disciples and institutes the
  bread and cup.
- Explain how He is the true Passover Lamb and how His blood delivers from sin and death.

## 5. Share the Meal

- Eat together, taking time to reflect on God's mercy.
- Use the unleavened bread and bitter herbs as teaching points.

## 6. Thanksgiving and Sending

- Close with a psalm, hymn, or simple song.
- Pray for grace to live as a redeemed people in holiness and love.

Feel free to adapt this pattern to your culture and household while keeping the **core story**
of God's redemption central.
