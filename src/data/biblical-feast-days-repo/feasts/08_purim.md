# Purim

## 1. Biblical Foundations

Purim is described in the Book of Esther. It commemorates the deliverance of the Jews in
Persia from Haman's plot to destroy them.

Key elements:

- Casting lots (purim) for the day of destruction.
- Esther's courageous intervention.
- Reversal of the decree and victory of the Jews.
- Instituting days of feasting, gladness, sending portions of food, and gifts to the poor.

## 2. Historical Development

Purim arises in the post‑exilic period, outside the Levitical cycle. It becomes a yearly
celebration of survival and God's providence, even when His name is hidden in the narrative.

## 3. Theological Themes

- God's hidden yet sovereign care.
- Courage and vocation "for such a time as this."
- Solidarity with the vulnerable.

## 4. Participating Today

Common patterns in remembrance:

- Reading or retelling the Esther story.
- Sharing festive meals.
- Giving gifts of food to friends and charity to the poor.
- Emphasizing God's faithfulness in times of threat.

Believers can join Purim remembrance as a way to celebrate God's preservation of His people
through history and to renew commitment to stand against injustice.
