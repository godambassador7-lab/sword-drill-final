# Overview of Biblical Feast Days and Sacred Times

This document gives a high‑level map of the main biblical feasts and sacred times, so that each
individual study can be read in context.

## Core Leviticus 23 Cycle

Leviticus 23 lays out the main annual "appointed times" (moedim):

1. **Weekly Sabbath (Shabbat)**
2. **Passover (Pesach)**
3. **Feast of Unleavened Bread (Chag HaMatzot)**
4. **Firstfruits (Reshit Katzir / Bikkurim)**
5. **Feast of Weeks / Pentecost (Shavuot)**
6. **Feast of Trumpets (Yom Teruah)**
7. **Day of Atonement (Yom HaKippurim)**
8. **Feast of Tabernacles / Booths (Sukkot)**

These are tightly tied to **agricultural rhythms in the land of Israel** and the **redemptive
acts of God** (especially the Exodus and covenant at Sinai).

## Additional Biblical and Post‑Biblical Feasts

In addition to Leviticus 23:

- **New Moons (Rosh Chodesh)** – recurring monthly markers.
- **Purim** – from the Book of Esther, commemorating deliverance in Persia.
- **Hanukkah / Feast of Dedication** – from the Maccabean period; mentioned in John 10:22.
- **Fast days** (not feasts, but important): e.g., the fast of the fifth month (Tisha B'Av).

## Pilgrimage Festivals

Deuteronomy 16 and elsewhere highlight three **pilgrimage festivals**, when Israelite males
were commanded to appear before the LORD at the chosen place (later the Temple in Jerusalem):

1. **Passover / Unleavened Bread**
2. **Feast of Weeks (Shavuot / Pentecost)**
3. **Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot)**

In Second Temple times, these were occasions for **massive pilgrimages to Jerusalem**, with
sacrifices, singing, processions, and community rejoicing.

## NT Engagement

The New Testament assumes familiarity with this calendar:

- Jesus celebrates **Passover** (including the Last Supper).
- The Spirit is poured out at **Pentecost**.
- Jesus goes up to **Tabernacles** and likely other feasts.
- The Gospels and Acts are dated against feast days.
- The only post‑biblical feast directly mentioned is the **Feast of Dedication** (Hanukkah).

The early Jesus‑movement was born **inside the Jewish liturgical year**, and the feasts function
as a **theological backdrop** for the gospel.

## Today: Key Principles

Because the Temple is destroyed and the once‑for‑all sacrifice of Messiah has been offered,
some elements of the feasts (especially animal sacrifices) are **no longer possible or necessary**.
Yet the **memorial, teaching, and rejoicing** aspects can still be embraced.

In the guides in this repo we focus on:

- Honoring the **biblical meaning** of each feast.
- Avoiding attempts to **rebuild the Levitical sacrificial system**.
- Emphasizing **remembrance, thanksgiving, repentance, and joy** in Messiah.
