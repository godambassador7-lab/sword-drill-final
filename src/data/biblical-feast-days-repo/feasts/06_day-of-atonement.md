# Day of Atonement (Yom HaKippurim)

## 1. Biblical Foundations

**Primary passages:** Leviticus 16; Leviticus 23:26–32; Numbers 29:7–11.

The Day of Atonement is the most solemn day in the biblical calendar. In the Torah:

- The high priest enters the Holy of Holies with blood.
- Atonement is made for the sanctuary, priests, and people.
- A "scapegoat" carries away iniquities into the wilderness.
- The people "afflict their souls" and do no work.

## 2. Historical Practice

In Temple times:

- Only the high priest entered the inner sanctuary, once a year.
- The day focused on national cleansing and restoration.
- Fasting and humility were emphasized among the people.

## 3. New Testament Fulfillment

The letter to the Hebrews sees Yom Kippur as a **shadow** of Messiah's once‑for‑all entry into
the true heavenly sanctuary, offering His own blood.

Key truths:

- The old system was temporary and anticipatory.
- Messiah's priesthood and sacrifice are superior and final.
- Believers now have bold access to the throne of grace.

## 4. Participating Today

We do not repeat the Levitical atonement rituals; Messiah has fulfilled them. But the **pattern
of a yearly day of sober reflection and repentance** can still be valuable.

Practical steps:

- Take the day for fasting or simplified eating, as health allows.
- Read Leviticus 16 and sections of Hebrews.
- Confess sins personally and corporately.
- Focus on the sufficiency of Messiah's atonement and the call to draw near.
