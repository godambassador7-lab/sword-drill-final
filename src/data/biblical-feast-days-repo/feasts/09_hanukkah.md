# Hanukkah / Feast of Dedication

## 1. Historical Foundations

Hanukkah is not instituted in the Torah but arises from events in the Maccabean period,
when the Temple was defiled under Antiochus IV and later cleansed and rededicated.

Key moments:

- Persecution of faithful Jews who refuse idolatry.
- Revolt led by the Maccabees.
- Recapture and rededication of the Temple.
- Institution of an eight‑day celebration.

The details are preserved in 1–2 Maccabees and later Jewish tradition.

## 2. New Testament Reference

The Gospel of John notes that Jesus was in Jerusalem at the **Feast of Dedication**, walking
in the Temple during winter. This shows that He moved within a Jewish world where Hanukkah
was already observed.

## 3. Themes

- Faithfulness under persecution.
- Cleansing and dedication of God's dwelling.
- Light in darkness.

## 4. Participating Today

Without binding conscience, some choose to:

- Light candles over eight nights as a reminder of dedication and perseverance.
- Read passages about faithfulness, persecution, and God's preserving power.
- Reflect on the call to be "temples" dedicated to God in a world of compromise.
