# Passover (Pesach)

## 1. Biblical Foundations

**Primary passages:** Exodus 12; Leviticus 23:4–5; Deuteronomy 16:1–8.

Passover commemorates God's deliverance of Israel from slavery in Egypt, especially the night
when the LORD "passed over" the homes marked with the blood of the lamb. It opens the season
of redemption and the spring feasts.

Key elements in Torah:

- A lamb without blemish, slain.
- Blood on the doorposts and lintel as a sign.
- The meal eaten in haste, with loins girded.
- Association with **Unleavened Bread** (they run together in practice).

## 2. Historical Practice in Biblical Times

### Exodus and Wilderness

In the Exodus event itself, the focus is on **protection and deliverance**.
In Numbers and Joshua we see later Passover celebrations marking covenant renewal.

### In the Land and Second Temple Period

By Second Temple times:

- Passover involved **pilgrimage to Jerusalem** for those able.
- Lambs were slaughtered in the Temple courts.
- The meal was eaten that evening in households or groups.
- Retelling of the Exodus story became central.

## 3. New Testament Connections

- Jesus celebrates Passover with his disciples in the **Last Supper**, reinterpreting bread and cup.
- The crucifixion occurs in Passover season, with Jesus presented as the true Passover Lamb.
- Paul explicitly calls Messiah "our Passover."

Passover thus becomes a key lens to understand **atonement, redemption, and new covenant**.

## 4. Theological Themes

- Redemption from bondage.
- Substitution and protection by blood.
- Judgment passing over those under God's sign.
- Freedom not just from Egypt but from sin and death in Messiah.

## 5. Participating Today (Without Temple Sacrifices)

Because there is no Temple and Messiah's sacrifice is complete, we do not attempt to offer
lambs as sin offerings. Instead, participation can focus on:

- **Timing:** Marking the Passover season in the first month of the biblical calendar.
- **Meal:** Sharing a structured meal that retells the Exodus and points to Messiah.
- **Symbols:**
  - Unleavened bread (reminding of haste and separation from sin).
  - Bitter herbs (bitterness of slavery).
  - Cups of blessing and thanksgiving.
- **Storytelling:** Reading the Exodus account and, for believers, the Gospel accounts of the
  Passion in connection with Passover.
- **Heart posture:** Gratitude for redemption, renewed commitment to live as a freed people.

### Simple Home Pattern

1. Light candles and open with prayer thanking God for deliverance.
2. Read selections from Exodus 12 and briefly explain to children or guests.
3. Share a meal that includes unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
4. Read a Gospel passage describing Jesus at Passover and his death and resurrection.
5. Close with thanksgiving and a song or psalm.

No one is required to follow a specific ritual script; the key is **remembering God's acts
of salvation** in both Exodus and Messiah.
