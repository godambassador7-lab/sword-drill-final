# Firstfruits (Reshit Katzir / Bikkurim)

## 1. Biblical Foundations

**Primary passages:** Leviticus 23:9–14; Deuteronomy 26:1–11.

Firstfruits marks the beginning of the barley harvest. An omer of the first sheaf is brought
to the priest, waved before the LORD, and certain offerings accompany it.

## 2. Historical Practice

In agrarian Israel:

- The festival underscored that **the land and its produce belong to God**.
- Farmers brought the first and best, acknowledging dependence on Him.

Deuteronomy 26 adds a liturgy where the worshiper recounts Israel's story
("My father was a wandering Aramean...") while bringing firstfruits.

## 3. New Testament Connections

Firstfruits becomes a powerful image:

- Messiah is called the **firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep**.
- The resurrection on the first day of the week, in the Passover/Firstfruits window,
  frames this theme of **new creation**.

## 4. Participating Today

Practical ways to honor the firstfruits principle:

- At the beginning of harvests or income cycles, set aside a first portion for the LORD
  (generosity, charity, support of ministry and the poor).
- Use this time to remember that everything we have is a gift.
- Share testimonies of God's provision in the past year.
