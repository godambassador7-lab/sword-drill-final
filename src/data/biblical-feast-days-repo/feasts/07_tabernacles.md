# Feast of Tabernacles / Booths (Sukkot)

## 1. Biblical Foundations

**Primary passages:** Leviticus 23:33–43; Deuteronomy 16:13–17; Numbers 29:12–38.

Sukkot is a week‑long harvest feast at the end of the agricultural year.

Key commands:

- Dwell in booths (sukkot) to remember Israel's wilderness sojourn.
- Rejoice before the LORD with branches and fruit.
- Offer numerous sacrifices.
- All males appear before the LORD at the chosen place.

## 2. Historical Practice

In ancient Israel:

- Families built temporary shelters and lived or ate in them for the week.
- The feast featured great rejoicing, music, and communal celebration.
- In Second Temple times, water‑drawing and lamp‑lighting ceremonies highlighted themes
  of light and living water.

## 3. New Testament Connections

In the Gospels:

- Jesus goes up to Jerusalem at Tabernacles.
- He proclaims Himself the source of **living water** and the **light of the world** in the
  context of Sukkot ceremonies.

Some prophetic passages link Sukkot to future universal worship.

## 4. Participating Today

Practical observance without Temple sacrifices:

- Build a simple booth or temporary structure (or decorate a porch) where meals or
  times of worship can be shared.
- Invite guests, especially those who might be lonely or in need.
- Remember God's past faithfulness in "wilderness seasons."
- Emphasize rejoicing in God's provision and presence.

Sukkot is especially suitable for **family camping‑style experiences** that blend joy,
storytelling, and hospitality.
