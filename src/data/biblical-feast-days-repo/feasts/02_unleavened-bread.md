# Feast of Unleavened Bread (Chag HaMatzot)

## 1. Biblical Foundations

**Primary passages:** Exodus 12:14–20; Leviticus 23:6–8; Deuteronomy 16:3–8.

The Feast of Unleavened Bread is a seven‑day festival immediately following Passover.
All leaven (hametz) is to be removed from the homes, and only unleavened bread is eaten.

Key features:

- Begins on the fifteenth day of the first month.
- First and seventh days are sacred assemblies with rest from ordinary work.
- It is a memorial of the haste of the Exodus.

## 2. Historical Practice

In biblical Israel:

- Families searched their homes and removed leaven beforehand.
- Daily offerings were made at the sanctuary.
- Pilgrims remained in and around Jerusalem for the full week in later periods.

## 3. New Testament Connections

The Gospels often refer to "the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called Passover," showing
how closely the two were linked in practice.

For Paul, **leaven** becomes an image of sin and corrupting influence; the community is to be
"unleavened" in sincerity and truth.

## 4. Theological Themes

- Separation from old life and old ways.
- Holiness and purity in daily life.
- Living as people in motion, ready to follow God's call.

## 5. Participating Today

Without the Temple:

- **Physical practice:** Many choose to remove leavened breads and eat simple, unleavened
  breads for the week as a tangible reminder.
- **Spiritual practice:** Use the week as a focused time of examining the heart for "hidden
  leaven"—practices, attitudes, or sins that need to be put away.
- **Teaching:** Families can connect the practice to Messiah, whose sinless life and sacrifice
  makes true cleansing possible.

Practical ideas:

- Do a "leaven search" with children, explaining how even small things can spread.
- Memorize or meditate on passages about holiness and new life.
