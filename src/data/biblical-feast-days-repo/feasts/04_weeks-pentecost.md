# Feast of Weeks / Pentecost (Shavuot)

## 1. Biblical Foundations

**Primary passages:** Leviticus 23:15–22; Deuteronomy 16:9–12; Numbers 28:26–31.

Shavuot is celebrated seven weeks after Firstfruits, marking the wheat harvest. It is one of
the three pilgrimage festivals.

Key features:

- Count seven full weeks from the day after the Sabbath / festival.
- Present new grain offerings, including two leavened loaves.
- Rejoice before the LORD with household, Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows.

Jewish tradition also associates Shavuot with the giving of the Torah at Sinai.

## 2. Historical Practice

In Second Temple times:

- Pilgrims came to Jerusalem with firstfruits of the "seven species" of the land.
- Processions and liturgical recitations accompanied the offerings.
- It was a time of national thanksgiving and covenant remembrance.

## 3. New Testament Connections

On Shavuot/Pentecost in Acts:

- The Spirit is poured out on the gathered disciples in Jerusalem.
- Pilgrims from many nations hear the mighty works of God.
- This feast of firstfruits becomes the **firstfruits of the multi‑national church**.

## 4. Theological Themes

- Harvest and gratitude.
- Torah and Spirit: God's law written on hearts.
- Unity in diversity under one Lord.

## 5. Participating Today

Ideas for observance:

- Set aside the day as one of focused thanksgiving for the Spirit's work.
- Read Exodus 19–20 and Acts 2 together.
- Pray for empowerment to bear witness and for a harvest of righteousness.
- Share a meal that includes bread as a symbol of the "two loaves"—Jew and Gentile together.
