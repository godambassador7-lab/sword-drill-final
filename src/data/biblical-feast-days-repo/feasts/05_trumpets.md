# Feast of Trumpets (Yom Teruah)

## 1. Biblical Foundations

**Primary passages:** Leviticus 23:23–25; Numbers 29:1–6.

Yom Teruah is a memorial of trumpet blasts on the first day of the seventh month. Scripture
gives fewer details than for other feasts, emphasizing:

- A day of rest.
- Blasting (or shouting) as a memorial before God.
- Sacrificial offerings.

Later Jewish tradition develops this into Rosh Hashanah, the "Head of the Year," with rich
liturgies of kingship, remembrance, and repentance.

## 2. Themes

Biblically grounded themes include:

- Kingship and enthronement.
- Warning and wake‑up call to repentance.
- Assembly of God's people.

Trumpet imagery also appears in prophetic and apocalyptic passages.

## 3. Participating Today

Without adding layers that Scripture does not require, believers can:

- Set apart the day in the seventh month as a day of solemn assembly and rejoicing.
- Use shofar or other trumpet sounds as a call to reflection and repentance.
- Read passages about God's kingship and the final trumpet.
- Examine hearts at the threshold of the fall feasts.
