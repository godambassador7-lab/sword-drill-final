# Weekly Sabbath (Shabbat)

Although often discussed separately from the annual feasts, the weekly Sabbath is presented
as the first of the appointed times.

## 1. Biblical Foundations

Sabbath is rooted in:

- Creation rest on the seventh day.
- The Exodus, where Israel is commanded to rest and grant rest to servants and animals.
- Covenant identity as a sign between God and His people.

## 2. Historical Practice

Israel's life was structured around a weekly rhythm of work and rest, with Sabbath as:

- A cessation from ordinary labor.
- A time for holy convocation.
- A sign of trust in God's provision.

## 3. New Testament Perspective

Jesus:

- Honors the Sabbath yet confronts burdensome interpretations.
- Declares Himself Lord of the Sabbath.
- Uses Sabbath healings to show the day's true purpose: mercy and restoration.

The early church meets both in the Temple and homes; over time, gatherings on the first day
of the week also appear as a resurrection marker.

## 4. Participating Today

Believers differ on how Sabbath applies, but basic principles include:

- Regular rhythm of rest and worship.
- Making space for mercy, joy, and refreshment.
- Remembering creation and redemption.

Households can mark a weekly day for ceasing from ordinary work, sharing meals, Scripture,
and fellowship in a way that fits their context and convictions.
