    "description": "<h3><strong>World English Bible, 2006</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong>Digital Bible Society<br />\nPublic Domain</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>The World English Bible</em> (WEB) is a Public Domain (no copyright) Modern English translation of the Holy Bible. That means that you may freely copy it in any form, including electronic and print formats. The World English Bible is based on the American Standard Version of the Holy Bible first published in 1901, the Biblia Hebraica Stutgartensa Old Testament, and the Greek Majority Text New Testament. The companion Deuterocanon/Apocrypha is derived from the Revised Version Apocrypha and the Brenton translation of the Septuagint into English. It is in draft form, and currently being edited for accuracy and readability. The 66 books of the Old and New Testaments are essentially completed, although some proofreading comments are still being accepted when they improve accuracy, readability, and consistency.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This Bible imported from The Unbound Bible <a href=\"http://unbound.biola.edu/\">http://unbound.biola.edu/</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
