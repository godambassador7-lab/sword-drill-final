Place public-domain WEB (World English Bible) book JSON files here as <Book>.json (e.g., John.json).

Same formats as KJV provider are supported:
1) { "book":"John", "chapters": { "3": { "16": "..." } } }
2) { "3": { "16": "..." }, "4": { ... } }

Files are loaded at runtime from /bible/web/<Book>.json and cached.
