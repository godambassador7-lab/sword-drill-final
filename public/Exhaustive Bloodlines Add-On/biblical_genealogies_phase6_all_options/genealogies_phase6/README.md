# Phase 6 – Unified Graph + Extended Data (All Options)

This phase delivers:

- OPTION A: Extended returnee house structures (Ezra 2 & Nehemiah 7 style)
- OPTION B: Extended Levitical/Temple role registry
- OPTION C: A unified `all_persons.json` merging core genealogies
- OPTION D: Precomputed graph indices (`graph_indices.json`)
- OPTION E: Geo-integration scaffolding for map visualizations

Note: While this is highly structured and extensive, it is not guaranteed
to include *every* biblical name. It is intended as a robust backbone you
can keep extending.
