# Phase 4 – Post‑Exilic Genealogies (Ezra & Nehemiah Core Pack)

This module extends the genealogical system with:
- Returnees from Babylon (Ezra 2; Neh 7)
- Priestly families, Levites, singers, gatekeepers
- Lay families by ancestral houses
- Mixed‑marriage resolution lists (Ezra 9–10)
- Wall‑builders (Neh 3) represented as genealogical entries where possible

This is a structured backbone, suitable for further expansions.
