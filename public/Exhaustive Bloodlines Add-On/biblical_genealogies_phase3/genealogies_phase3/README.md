# Biblical Genealogies – Phase 3 (1 Chronicles 4–9 Expansion)

This phase expands the genealogical backbone with:
- Full Simeonite chiefs (1 Chr 4)
- Full Judah town-lineage expansions
- Tribe of Reuben (1 Chr 5)
- Tribe of Gad (1 Chr 5)
- Half-tribe of Manasseh (east)
- Priestly & Levitical genealogical rosters (1 Chr 6–9)
- Post‑exilic returnees genealogical summaries

This is a structured expansion using the same schema as earlier phases.
