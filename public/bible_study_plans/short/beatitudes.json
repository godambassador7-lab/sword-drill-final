      "overview": "The Beatitudes begin with Jesus teaching about true blessedness. Today we explore the first three beatitudes: being poor in spirit, mourning, and meekness. These virtues reflect humility before God and a heart that recognizes its spiritual poverty.",
      "reflection": "What does it mean to be 'poor in spirit'? How does spiritual poverty lead to receiving the kingdom of heaven? In what ways can mourning and meekness be considered blessed?",
      "prayer": "Ask God to reveal areas where you need greater humility and spiritual dependence on Him."
